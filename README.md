# FastLED-OpenGL

Provides a way to simulate addressable LEDs with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) using [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)

This is used in [GeoLEDic](https://github.com/samsta/GeoLEDic) and I've broken it out into a separate repository in case it might be useful to someone else. At this point I'm intending to add just the functionality needed in GeoLEDic, and no more.

Status: very early stage...
